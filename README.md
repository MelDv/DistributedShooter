# Distributed Shooter

## Distributed Systems course - Programming Task 2021

All my scipts are in the Assets/Scripts/ folder.

The game can be played with a standalone build found in this [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cq5aZR8VzU6vppwpf5q_s0CJaZd1FA2-). The game build is in the folder DistributedShooterGame. Download the folder, extract it, and double click on DistributedShooter.exe.   

You can also play the game by downloading the project from this repository. Due to GitHub repository size limitations (10GB) I was not able to upload all the necessary files here. To get the right textures and terrain, you can download the Assets folder from the same Drive folder as the standalone build (link above). The project can be opened in Unity, preferably with version 2021.2.2f1. After the project has opened, you can play by pressing the play icon on the top of the screen.
