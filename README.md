# Distributed Shooter

## Distributed Systems course - Programming Task 2021

All scipts written by me are in the Assets/Scripts folder.

Due to GitHub repo size limitations (10GB) I was not able to upload all the necessary files here. To get the right textures and terrain, you can download the [Assets folder] at(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uvJu9iGu96vPoRg8tGvFxS_-HCdxPjuy?usp=sharing)  

The final [project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y667sHizHCqbZ74C8EBlDwTeMErk6T3g/)  
Game information is listed at the [website](http://128.214.253.86/api/)  

You can play the game by downloading the project from this repo and replacing the Assets folder with the one you can download from the separate link above. The project can be opened in Unity, preferably with version 2021.2.2f1. After the project has opened, you can play by pressing the play icon on the top of the screen.
